Air Quality Analysis Summary - Beaumont Area
===========================================

Date: April 8, 2024
Author: aritrode29

1. Overview
----------
This analysis examines air quality data from two monitoring stations in the Beaumont area:
- Beaumont Downtown
- Nederland 17th Street

The study focuses on identifying and analyzing compounds associated with refinery operations, with concentrations analyzed in two ranges:
- Low concentration compounds (< 2 µg/m³, shown in ng/m³)
- High concentration compounds (≥ 2 µg/m³, shown in µg/m³)

This dual-scale approach provides better resolution for both trace-level compounds and those with higher concentrations, enabling more detailed analysis of air quality patterns and their potential health impacts.

2. Key Findings

2.1 Refinery-Associated Compounds
--------------------------------
The analysis identified three main categories of refinery-related compounds:

A. Aromatics (Red)
   - Primary compounds: Benzene, Toluene, Xylenes
   - Secondary compounds: Ethylbenzene, Styrene, Trimethylbenzenes

B. Olefins (Teal)
   - Primary compounds: Ethylene, Propylene
   - Secondary compounds: 1,3-Butadiene, Butenes
   - Source: Fluid catalytic cracking units

4. Health Impact Analysis
----------------------
4.1 Aromatics Health Implications
--------------------------------
A. Benzene:
   - Carcinogenic compound (IARC Group 1)
   - Short-term effects: Drowsiness, dizziness, headaches
   - Long-term effects: Blood disorders, leukemia risk
   - Observed levels generally below acute health guidelines
   - Requires continuous monitoring due to no safe threshold

B. Toluene & Xylenes:
   - Neurological system impacts
   - Short-term effects: Eye/throat irritation, headaches
   - Long-term effects: Cognitive function impacts
   - Concentrations typically below health concern levels

C. Ethylbenzene & Styrene:
   - Possible carcinogens (IARC Group 2B)
   - Respiratory system irritants
   - Neurological effects at high exposures
   - Current levels below regulatory guidelines

4.2 Olefins Health Implications
------------------------------
A. 1,3-Butadiene:
   - Known carcinogen (IARC Group 1)
   - Cardiovascular system impacts
   - Reproductive system effects
   - Requires careful monitoring despite low concentrations

B. Ethylene & Propylene:
   - Lower toxicity compared to other compounds
   - Mild respiratory irritants
   - No significant long-term effects at observed levels
   - Serve as indicators for overall refinery emissions

4.3 Alkanes Health Implications
-----------------------------
- Generally lower toxicity than aromatics
- Primary concerns:
  * Short-term respiratory irritation
  * Central nervous system effects at high levels
  * Contribution to ground-level ozone formation
- Current levels suggest minimal direct health risks

4.4 Vulnerable Populations
------------------------
Special consideration needed for:
1. Children:
   - More susceptible to respiratory effects
   - Higher breathing rates relative to body size
   - Developing organ systems

2. Elderly:

   - Pre-existing conditions
   - Compromised immune systems

3. Individuals with:
   - Asthma
   - Cardiovascular disease
   - Respiratory conditions
   - Compromised immune systems

4.5 Community Health Recommendations
---------------------------------
1. Public Awareness:

   - Health advisory systems
   - Educational programs about air quality

2. Healthcare Provider Engagement:
   - Alert systems for high concentration events
   - Tracking of respiratory complaints
